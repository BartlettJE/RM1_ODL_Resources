# MSLQ Overview {#MSLQ-overview}

## General overview of the research project

In this course, we are preparing you to read and appraise journal articles, and write up an empirical quantitative research project yourself. Throughout the lectures and independent learning in semester 1 and 2, you will learn how to formulate a research question, design a study, apply statistical analyses, and write up your results to communicate to others as a research report.

In your group, you decide on a topic and collectively write a pre-registration. Individually, you will then write a full research report containing an abstract, introduction, method, results, and discussion. In the [next chapter](#Prereg-overview), we will outline the difference between a pre-registration and full report. For the rest of this chapter, we outline the data set you will be working with in more detail.

::: {.warning data-latex=""}
One aspect that causes some confusion is whether you need to collect any data for this project or not. The simple answer is **no**. We have been collecting data using this questionnaire for the past few years and we have already a large amount of data for you to work with. You will be able to use the data to address a research question you develop in your group, within the parameters of the variables we have available. 
:::

However, we do think it is great practice for you to take part in the study to get a sense of it and to understand the study, as you will be writing about it from the perspective of the researcher. You can complete the study through the link on Moodle. But just to clarify, you **will not** gather data from anyone but yourself and you **will not** design your own questionnaire or study in this project

Everyone will use the same questionnaire and data which we provide. This will allow us to focus on improving your skills in creating and carrying out a research question and ultimately writing it up.

## Research project topic

### MSLQ

The broad topic of the research project is **self-regulated learning**. 

Self-regulated learning models describe learning in terms of taking control of and evaluating one's own learning and behaviour. The study you will write up uses a questionnaire called the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ, Pintrich et al., 1991).

```{r self reg image, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Supporting/self-reg-learning.jpg")
```

The MSLQ has two sections, motivation and learning strategies, each with multiple sub-scales. One of these scales may form part of the analysis you write up. There is more information about what each of these scales measures in the MSLQ Overview document, which you can [download using this link](Supporting/MSLQ Overview.docx), or you can find it on the Semester 2 Week 1 Moodle page.

**Motivation sub-scales**

- Intrinsic goal orientation

- Extrinsic goal orientation

- Task value

- Control beliefs

- Self-efficacy

- Test anxiety

**Learning strategy sub-scales**

- Rehearsal

- Elaboration

- Organisation

- Critical thinking

- Meta-cognition

- Time and study environment

- Effort regulation

- Peer learning

- Help-seeking

### Demographic variables

In addition to the MSLQ, we also have a selection of demographic information about the participants and you may choose to use one of these variables in your analysis, or use it to isolate a particular population of interest.

- Age in years

- Gender (male/female/non-binary)

- Native vs non-native speakers

- Paid employment in hours

- Living at home vs living in halls

- Level of study (undergraduate vs postgraduate)

- Mature student vs traditional student (for undergraduate students only)

## Distinguishing types of research questions

You are going to conduct one of two types of statistical analyses in your study and it is up to you and your group to decide which one. You will conduct either a **correlation** or a **t-test** analysis. These answer different questions:

- Correlations assess whether there is a relationship between two variables

- t-tests assess whether there is a difference between two groups

To help you understand a little more, if you are thinking about which sub-scales might be correlated with each other or related, you might ask such research questions as: 

1. Is help-seeking and test anxiety related? Are students who are more likely to seek help, less likely to be anxious about their assessments?

2. Is intrinsic goal orientation and effort regulation related? Are students who engage in learning for the challenge and to learn something new (rather than just to get good grades/pass the test) better at studying consistently throughout the semester and completing their goals?

If you are thinking about which sub-scales might show group differences, you might ask such research questions as:

1. Do mature students have lower test anxiety than traditional students?

2. Do postgraduate students have higher intrinsic motivation than undergraduate students?

We will go into more detail about how to create formal research questions and hypotheses in future weeks. Starting in week 2, we will show you how to find peer-reviewed evidence to build your understanding of the variables, identify a rationale, and develop your research question and hypothesis.

::: {.warning data-latex=""}
Your write up must contain a correlation analysis or a t-test analysis and so your research question, and ultimately your hypothesis, must be able to be answered by one of those approaches.

## MSLQ suggested variable pairs

Now you have an understanding of what the MSLQ project is, we have a list of variable pairs that have worked well in the past and we know that there is some existing literature to base your study on. 

### **t-test** for comparing two categories

- Test anxiety and undergraduate vs postgraduate, or years 1 and 2 vs years 3-5 (pre-honours vs honours at the University of Glasgow)

- Help-seeking and first vs second language 

- Meta-cognitive self-regulation and non-mature vs mature undergraduate student status

- Meta-cognitive self-regulation and undergraduate vs postgraduate study, or years 1 and 2 vs years 3-5 (pre-honours vs honours at the University of Glasgow)

- Self-efficacy and undergraduate vs postgraduate study

- Intrinsic motivation and undergraduate vs postgraduate study

### **Correlation** for the association between two variables. 

- Self-efficacy and help-seeking

- Test anxiety and meta-cognitive self-regulation

- Test anxiety and self-efficacy 

- Self-efficacy and help-seeking

- Intrinsic motivation and age

::: {.info data-latex=""}
**Wild card for two different variables.** If you want to choose two different variables from the suggestions above, you and your group can decide that. We outlined these pairs as we know they can work well together for the report, and you must make any changes in collaboration with all the members of your group. Note that this is a riskier choice, so you and your group should discuss your planned direction with the course team. Once you settle on two variables, you might also focus on a specific population in your group as you develop your rationale, like focusing on postgraduate students if you recognise there is a gap in the literature, so there is still creative freedom beyond choosing the variable pairs.
