<ul>
<li><p>We use the group work agreement to outline how you and your group will work and communicate with each other, and ensure you are engaging in the group work process for the pre-registration. Groups typically experience problems when communication and task responsibilities are built on unspoken assumptions. You might not know everyone in your group when we make the allocations, so we start the project by facilitating a discussion with you and your group so you can openly outline how you will communicate, <a href="groupagreement-AIS.html#group-work-advice">respect diversity</a>, and <a href="groupagreement-AIS.html#prereg-planning">split tasks</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a formative task and is <strong>not</strong> part of the summative assessment for the course, but everyone must complete the task. We use the group work agreement as a way of identifying engagement and potential problems as early as possible. The course or programme leads will contact students who <strong>do not</strong> submit their group work agreement. At first, we will help mediate any problems to facilitate the group assignment. If there are further problems, then students may be reallocated to an individual submission.</p></li>
<li><p>The deadline is <strong>March 8th 2024</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Although you will agree on the document as a group, each group member must then <strong>individually</strong> sign (electronic or a printed name, you do not need to physically sign it) and upload a copy to the submission portal.</p></li>
<li><p>You should submit a single Word document (.docx) or PDF document to Moodle prior to the deadline. The submission link is open from when the group allocations are available in week 2. You can find the submission portal in the Group Allocations, Resources, and Agreement Submission tab.</p></li>

</h2>
<p>The group work agreement template (available for download in the RM1 ODL "Moodle Group Allocations, Resources, and Agreement Submission" tab) contains five points that we have set, but you may add any additional points that the group agrees.</p>
<p>The mandatory points are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>As a student of the University of Glasgow, I will treat all members of my group with dignity and respect.</p></li>
<li><p>I have read and agree to abide by the Student code of conduct and the Dignity at work and study policy.</p></li>
<li><p>We all agree to communicate with each other openly and tell the course leads well in advance should any issues arise.</p></li>
<li><p>We all agree to use a group chat on Microsoft Teams as our main electronic channel of communication.</p></li>
<li><p>We all agree to contribute to the group project and complete the assigned tasks by a deadline agreed by the group.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, there may be other elements of group work that you and your group want to include. Here is a list of items you may want to discuss with your group and add to the document:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We all agree to establish a common timeline for the project and discuss any deviations from the timeline together as a group.</p></li>
<li><p>We all agree to communicate with each other openly and honestly about the project and get in touch with the course leads in the event of an unsolvable group conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>We all agree to respect each other's individual ways of working and discuss these openly as a group.</p></li>
<li><p>We all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks. We agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>I agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group. If I am struggling and I do not feel comfortable sharing that with the group, I will get in touch with the course/programme leads for support.</p></li>
<li><p>We all agree to meet on a regular basis as established by the group. If I cannot make a meeting I agree to communicate this openly with my group and get in touch to catch up about things I have missed.</p></li>
<li><p>We agree to plan out the individual contribution of each team member in advance before group work starting and openly communicate any changes that may arise during the project.</p></li>
<li><p>We agree to establish the best method of communication for our group that's inclusive and takes into account everybody's individual needs.</p></li>

<p>Below are some guidelines to organise and manage your group project for the pre-registration. You are welcome to adapt some of these guidelines to suit your group and the nature of the project. However, in the event we need to mediate difficulties, this will involve you providing evidence of collaboration (or lack thereof). Please be mindful of this when conducting your project.</p>
<p><strong>Set up your group Teams chat/channel and a Planner for your group</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DO: Create a Teams chat for communication with your group.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Create a Planner with all members of your group.</p></li>
<li><p>DON’T: Use WhatsApp, Facebook or WeChat etc. to coordinate your project as it that excludes people who cannot access this technology in some countries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coordinate work schedules/calendars</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DO: Be open about when you can meet/study, if you have a busy period coming up, or might be unavailable.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Schedule a regular ‘check-in’ time. This does not need to be a live meeting but stay connected regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>DON’T: Commit to meetings/time frames that will not work for your time table or work schedule.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agree on document collaboration platforms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DO: We recommend having a shared OneDrive folder or sharing documents within your Teams channel using the files tab.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Use track changes and comments on shared documents.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Think about a shared Zotero, EndNote, or similar library to organise references/papers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work back from the deadline to create milestones</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DO: Be mindful of your work/life balance and upcoming busy periods.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Agree on specific dates to complete your responsibilites.</p></li>
<li><p>DON’T: Leave things to the last minute.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Determine strengths and assign roles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DO: Consult the <a href="groupagreement-AIS.html#prereg-planning">pre-registration planning advice section below</a> to identify the strengths/preferences of your team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assign tasks/milestones to roles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DO: Attach names and dates to tasks and assign milestones.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Reassign tasks/adjust deadlines if you need to as the project progresses.</p></li>
<li><p>DON’T: Assign time-sensitive roles that might clash with someone’s known upcoming commitments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communicate, communicate, communicate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DO: Check-in regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Agree to action points at the end of meetings and put these in writing (e.g., in a wiki/to-do list).</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Let your group know if you are struggling with a task/milestone.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Be kind and compassionate (to yourself and others).</p></li>
<li><p>DON’T: Take things personally. We all know text/online communication can sound differently from how it is intended.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit your Assessment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DO: Assign one person to prepare and submit the final documents when everyone has approved them. Remember to turn off track changes.</p></li>
<li><p>DO: Give yourself time to look at the Turnitin Report.</p></li>
<li><p>DON’T: Forget to check you are uploading the correct intended file.</p></li>

<p>As an ODL programme, you may not be able to meet synchronously, so make sure you discuss how you will complete your group work and share your progress for shared tasks. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a shared OneDrive folder or Teams channel/chat where you can share and collaborate on files.</p></li>
<li><p>R Markdown does not work well collaboratively, but you can collaboratively write the five questions through a shared Word file within OneDrive or Teams, or a Google doc. Once you are all happy with your answers, you can copy and paste into your master .Rmd file.</p></li>
<li><p>You could create a shared Zotero folder to add all the articles you found for the rationale and support your decisions.</p></li>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Points about inclusivity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#points-about-inclusivity"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Language</strong>: Many students in this programme are studying in their second, third, or even fourth language. Consider the challenges you might experience if you were studying beyond your first language and be mindful of making implicit judgements about someone’s writing or communication.</p>
<p><strong>Timing/working patterns</strong>: Be mindful that everyone’s life balance and commitments are different. Some people prefer studying during traditional working hours, some in the evenings, and others on weekends. Communicate your preferences openly and as a group be as flexible and accommodating as you can. Can the times/days of meetings be flexible if this helps everyone contribute and feel engaged?</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>: The technology/platforms we recommend might not be your favourites, but we recommend them for a reason. These are things we can directly support, and they are the things that we make sure all students in different countries can access. Using some apps/tools can explicitly exclude some members that want to engage and contribute.</p>
<p><strong>Neurodiversity</strong>: Different people work and think in different ways. If someone discloses that they find particular things challenging, or that they are at their best with a particular type of task or activity, consider how you can support/reflect this in the allocation of roles and tasks. Everyone works best in a positive strengths-based environment!</p>
</div>
<div id="supporting-self-efficacygroup-dynamics" class="section level3" number="3.3.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Supporting self-efficacy/group dynamics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#supporting-self-efficacygroup-dynamics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Ostracism</strong>: Group dynamics can be one of the trickiest things to manage in a project, especially if you feel like you are the “new person” coming into an established group. For the sake of everyone and your project, avoid implicitly or explicitly creating an in-group/out-group situation and ostracising people.</p>
<p><strong>Positivity</strong>: Try to maintain a positive tone about the project, even if you find it challenging. There is a fine line between having a little vent/catharsis and creating an atmosphere of toxic negativity. Some team members might take this to heart more than others and become dispirited about the activity, their abilities, and the completion of the task. If you are feeling frustrated or finding a particular thing challenging, talk to your group and consider seeking advice or support from the teaching team.</p>
<p><strong>Imposter syndrome</strong>: Everyone gets this! It does not matter how we might be coping, sometimes it is impossible to avoid feeling like you or your work might not be good enough. If you are anxious about sharing something with your group, seek feedback from someone you trust first for their advice. Do not be afraid to make mistakes. Think about your shared documents as ‘working drafts’. Do not think you have to be anything other than who you are with your group. The pressure of thinking you must pretend to be a “model” student or meet the perceived expectations of others can get in the way of your being able to contribute your unique skills and experience.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Pre-registration group work task sharing advice<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prereg-planning"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>As you start working in your groups, one key decision will be sharing out the tasks equitably. In the pre-registration template, there are several sections and sub-sections to complete. For each component, try to summarise the following when you first meet with your group:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What information have you already established in that section?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you still need to think about for that section?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you going to find answers to the things you do not yet know?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you might say for question 1:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>What have you already established?</strong>: So far, we know the Research Question and the Hypothesis and we have a general summary of relevant papers written by the team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What do we still need to think about?</strong>: We do not yet have a fully formed rationale or a solid understanding of the general overview.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How will you find answers to things you do not yet know?</strong> Phil, Helena, and Ashley will read the papers that have already been collected and the general summary. From there, they will try to write a draft of the general topic and finalise the rationale so that it builds on what previous research has found. They will then present that to the group for further revision and discussion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have done that for each section, go through and answer the following question: Who will lead on each section?</p>
<p>Each group member should make an equal contribution, but this does not mean every group member works on every section. Some sections might work better with one person leading and another editing, while other sections might work better with several people leading and editing. Just keep in mind, it is important you understand all aspects of the pre-registration, so we recommend if you work on one or two questions, you edit or at least proof-read the other questions.</p>
<p>For example, you might write:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Question 1</em>: Phil, Helena, and Ashley will lead on this section.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Question 2</em>: Wil and Maxine will lead on this section.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Question 3</em>: James and Alexia will lead on this section.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Question 4</em>: Helena and Wil will lead on this section.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Question 5</em>: Maxine and Phil will lead on this section.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Code</em>: Alexia, Ashley, and James will lead on the Code.</p></li>
</ul>
