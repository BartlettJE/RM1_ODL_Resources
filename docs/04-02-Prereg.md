# Pre-Registration versus Full Report {#Prereg-overview}

The two main submissions for this project are:

1. The Group Pre-Registration (30%)

2. The Individual Full Report (50%)

These are two individual but connected assignments. The distinction between the pre-registration and full report will be clearer as you learn about the life cycle of research and the structure of a full report.  A pre-registration is basically a plan of what you are going to do. It outlines the rationale for the study (a brief review of the background
literature and why you are doing this study), your method, and your analytical approach and the reasoning behind decisions (i.e., why you have chosen to analyse the data in this way). Finally, the pre-registration documents the analytical code you
will use to analyse your data. 

So really a pre-registration is about what you will do and
why. You can see some real world examples here: https://osf.io/e6auq/wiki/Example%20Preregistrations/

In contrast, a full report documents what you have already done and why, what did you find out, and what does it all mean? You will be familiar with these reports from reading in other courses - these are basically journal articles. You have an in-depth
Introduction, a detailed Methods and Results, and then a Discussion about what it all means.

To highlight some key differences:

- The preregistration is normally written in future tense whereas the full report is largely
written in the present or past tense.

- The pre-registration is a short version of the introduction and methods, with the analytical code whereas the full report is a much more in-depth introduction and methods, and includes the results and the discussion.

So, in this project you will first create and submit a pre-registration of the project (submitting your research question, hypothesis, rationale, analytical methods and code) as a group. You will then get feedback on this before analyzing the data as you said you would and writing up the full report.

To help you make some of the analytical decisions for the pre-registration, we will give you a
small subset of the full data (for example, 30 participants from the full dataset). This is purely to help you see what the data will look like and **will not** make up any of the final results in the full report or any summary data in the pre-registration. In short, the subset data we give you for the pre-registration is purely to help generate the code and should not be discussed in your final report. 

Hopefully this gives some insight into these two pieces but again there is a long way to go and plenty of time to ask questions so please do so!
